# anisotropy-github-repo

This is a repository of all relevant code in Mercer ICECUBE anisotropy investigation. This requires data extraction, identification of errors, attempted fixes, and reprocessing. It also includes code for rate plots to visualize the removal of errors and skymaps to examine a statistical representation of the data that improves in accuracy as errors are removed.
